# todo
A simple to-do list app.

## Running
`todo` is written in React with the help of Vite, so install required dependencies with the packager of your choice (`npm install`, `yarn` or what have you) and run the `dev` command (`npm run dev`, `yarn dev`) to start up a server with the app in development mode.

## Usage

Use the plus button at the top to add new tasks.

To mark a task as done click the check button. It will be removed from the list in 5 seconds (unless you stop the process by clicking once again in that timeframe) and registered as a "Done" task. To remove a task without marking it as done, use the trashcan button.

Click on the name of a task to begin changing its name and click outside of it or press Enter to finish.

Tasks may be divided into subtasks. To add one, use the encircled plus buttonâ€”likewise, to remove one, use the trashcan button. A parent task may not be marked as done until all of its subtasks are marked as done, but it may be removed anyway.

## Possible improvements
* The interface feels super clunky, some animation (e.g. `div.animated` from `react-spring`) couldn't hurt.

* On a similar note, tasks (and subtasks) could be drag-and-droppable to enable changing their order.

* I have mixed feelings about the placement of the plus button but I couldn't settle on a less worse place to put it.

* Responsive with respect to mobile on a very minimal level. The mobile interface could be greatly more suited to the limitations of its viewport.

* The "Done" window is kind of ugly. (Not surprising since it was a last-minute idea.) We could work on it.

* It's possible that "double-click in 5 seconds to remove/mark as done" is a more efficient and comfortable manner of handling things than "click and wait 5 seconds to remove/mark as done". Maybe it's subjective though? In any case reworking this wouldn't be hard.

* On the code side, the `Task` component is kind of bulky. Maybe it could be tidied up and broken up into smaller pieces a little.

* CSS was written in a stream-of-consciousness manner. It should probably be tidied up too.
